#STM32F4 Basic Codes
These are some of the basic examples that were written while I was exploring STM32F407VGT microcontroller.

##CAN-Input
	The code is for performing communication using [CANBUS] (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) at 125kbps.

##RAJAT_ADC_InternalTemp_Poll
	The code is for getting internal temperature of the STM32F4 board using polling method.

##RAJAT_UART_IT_Mode
	The code is for communicating in interrupt mode via [UART] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter).

##RAJAT_ADC_INTtemp_IT
	The code is for getting internal temperature of the STM32F4 board using interrupt method.

##RAJAT_ADC_Sensor_IT
	The code is for getting sensor data from the ADC sensors attached to the STM32F4 board using interrupt method.

##RAJAT_BSRR
	The code manipulates bits for blinking in built LEDs of STM32F4 board.

##RAJAT_UserIpBlinky
	The code performs setting LEDs to ON while user gives input by pressing input button.

##RAJAT_UserIpBlinky_ExtInterrupt
	The code performs setting LEDs to ON while user gives input by pressing input button using interrupt method.

##SPI-BSP
	The code is for getting data of x, y, z axis from the inbuilt accelerometer sensor attached to the STM32F4 board using interrupt method.
	
##SimpleBlinky
	The code performs blinking of LEDs.

##TIMUSAssignPrescalar
		The code performs blinking LEDs on a certain time interval.

##pushButton
	The code performs setting LEDs to ON while user gives input by pressing input button.
