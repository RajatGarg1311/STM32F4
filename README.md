# STM32F4 Basic Codes
These are some of the basic examples that were written while I was exploring STM32F407VGT microcontroller.

## CAN-Input
The code is for performing communication using [CANBUS](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) at 125kbps.

## RAJAT_ADC_InternalTemp_Poll
The code is for getting internal temperature of the STM32F4 board using polling method.

## RAJAT_UART_IT_Mode
The code is for communicating in interrupt mode via [UART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter).

## RAJAT_ADC_INTtemp_IT
The code is for getting internal temperature of the STM32F4 board using interrupt method.

## RAJAT_ADC_Sensor_IT
The code is for getting sensor data from the ADC sensors attached to the STM32F4 board using interrupt method.

## RAJAT_BSRR
The code manipulates bits for blinking in built LEDs of STM32F4 board.

## RAJAT_UserIpBlinky
The code performs setting LEDs to ON while user gives input by pressing input button.

## RAJAT_UserIpBlinky_ExtInterrupt
The code performs setting LEDs to ON while user gives input by pressing input button using interrupt method.

## SPI-BSP
The code is for getting data of x, y, z axis from the inbuilt accelerometer sensor attached to the STM32F4 board using interrupt method.
	
## SimpleBlinky
The code performs blinking of LEDs.

## TIMUSAssignPrescalar
The code performs blinking LEDs on a certain time interval.

## pushButton
The code performs setting LEDs to ON while user gives input by pressing input button.
